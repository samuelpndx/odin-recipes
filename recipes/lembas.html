    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lembas, often referred to as Elvish waybread, is a special type of sustenance in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.
        Crafted by the Elves, this unique bread serves as a compact and highly nutritious food source, known for its
        dense texture and slightly sweet taste. In "The Lord of the Rings," characters rely on lembas as a vital
        provision during their arduous journeys. Each small, carefully wrapped portion is said to provide a remarkable
        amount of energy, making it an iconic and essential element in the lore of Middle-earth.
    </p>
    <p>In the narrative, lembas is not only a practical provision but also carries a symbolic significance. Crafted with
        Elvish craftsmanship and imbued with a touch of magic, it reflects the connection between the Elves and their
        land. Its qualities go beyond mere sustenance, hinting at the deeper mystical threads woven into Tolkien's
        richly imagined world.

                <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.</li>
                <li>Use a knife or a square-shaped cookie cutter to cut the dough into small, square-shaped pieces,
                    resembling waybread.</li>
