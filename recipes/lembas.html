            </li>
            <li>Mix the ingredients well, and add water gradually until the dough reaches a firm and cohesive
                consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Shape the Lembas:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li>Use a knife or a square-shaped cookie cutter to cut the dough into small, square-shaped pieces,
                resembling waybread.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake:</li>
        <ul>

        <li>Cool and Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow the lembas to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.</li>
