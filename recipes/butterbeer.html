    <img src="../images/butterbeer.jpg" alt="Two cups of butterbeer">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butterbeer, a beloved wizarding beverage in the Harry Potter universe, is renowned for its distinctive sweet and
        slightly buttery flavor. Served in various forms, including hot, cold, and frozen, the drink boasts a frothy,
        golden head akin to the foam atop a well-poured pint of beer. Found in magical establishments like The Three
        Broomsticks Inn in Hogsmeade, Butterbeer is a favorite among wizards and witches. Its consumption is a
        quintessential part of the Harry Potter experience, often enjoyed in the company of friends and fellow magical
        folk.</p>
    <p>In the real world, Butterbeer has been brought to life at Harry Potter-themed attractions, capturing the essence
        of the fictional drink. The closely guarded recipe typically involves a combination of sweet flavors, cream
        soda, and a frothy topping, creating a delightful beverage that mirrors the magical allure of J.K. Rowling's
        wizarding world.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon rum extract</li>
        <li>4 (12 oz) bottle cream soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar and water. Bring to a gentle boil and cook,
            stirring often, until the mixture reads 240Â°F on a candy thermometer.</li>
        <li>Stir in the butter, salt, vinegar and 1/4 of the heavy cream. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture has cooled, stir in the rum extract.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup of heavy cream.
            Use an electric mixer to beat until just thickened, but not completely whipped, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve: divide the brown sugar mixture between 4 tall glasses (about 1/4 cup for each glass). Add 1/4 cup
            of cream soda to each glass, then stir to combine. Fill each glass nearly to the top with additional cream
            soda, then spoon the whipped topping over each.</li>
    </ol>
