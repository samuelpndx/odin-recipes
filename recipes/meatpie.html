    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Sinister Meat Pie, an homage to the haunting tale of Sweeney Todd, is a culinary masterpiece shrouded in dark
        mystique. Its filling, a blend of humanely sourced minced meat, blood-red wine, and a medley of finely chopped
        onions, garlic, and mushrooms, weaves an intricate dance of savory malevolence. Encased in a pastry born from
        flour sifted through shadows and butter from the gloomiest abyss, each sinister bite unveils a tantalizing
        fusion of textures—a tender union of meat within a crust that whispers with a subtle crunch.</p>
    <p>Served with a side of Mrs. Lovett's Special Gravy, this diabolical creation promises an unforgettable gastronomic
        experience. As one indulges in the Sinister Meat Pie, the flavors unfold like a sinister symphony, leaving an
        eerie aftertaste that lingers, akin to the haunting echoes of a ghostly waltz. It's a culinary journey that
        transcends the ordinary, inviting daring souls to savor a taste both unsettling and undeniably delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb humanely sourced, high-quality minced meat (substitute with beef or lamb for a less sinister version)
        </li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup mushrooms, finely diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional, for a rich flavor)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon rosemary</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic, sautéing until
            translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the minced meat and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become golden.</li>
        <li>Pour in the red wine (if using) to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Simmer until the mixture has a rich, savory flavor. Set aside to
            cool.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Crust:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the chilled, cubed butter.</li>
        <li>Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse
            crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half. Roll out one half to line the bottom of your pie dish and the other for the top
            crust.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembly:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Line a pie dish with the rolled-out dough for the bottom crust.</li>
        <li>Spoon the cooled meat filling into the pie dish, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the second rolled-out dough on top, sealing the edges by crimping with a fork or your fingers.</li>
        <li>Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the meat pie to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
